# WebApp Theming Workshop

#### Martijn Alberts
#### Ronald Toussaint

---

# Outline

- Set up a development environment
- Create the Coca-Cola theme
- Create your own theme

---

# Setting up your development environment

- Oracle VirtualBox
- Virtual Machine provided
    - root/root
- http://192.168.56.101/kopano-webapp
    - user1/user1, user2/user2, ...,  user5/user5

---

# Editing files

- nano &amp; vim are installed on the virtual machine
- Use your own editor on host sytem by creating a shared folder in VirtualBox
    - Call the shared folder 'theming2017'
    - Copy the WebApp files to the shared folder:
    ```bash
    $ cp -r /usr/share/kopano-webapp /media/sf_theming2017
    ```
    - This Webapp should now be available at http://192.168.56.101/shared-kopano-webapp
---

# About themes and plugins

- Theming uses the pluggable architecture of the WebApp
- A theme extends the *Zarafa.core.ThemePlugin*, which extends *Zarafa.core.Plugin*. So a theme is a also a plugin!
- Begin by simply copying the example theme

---

# Creating the Coca-Cola theme

## Setup your new theme

- Rename the theme directory
- Update the manifest file
- Update the main plugin file (js/Theme.js)

---

# Setting your theme as default theme

- Open config.php
- Change the define for "THEME"
```php
	// General WebApp theme. This will be loaded by default for every user
	// (if the theme is installed as a plugin)
	// Users can override the 'logged-in' theme in the settings.
	define("THEME", 'themecocacola');
```
Refresh your browser. Does it show the new theme?

---

# Selecting your theme as user

- Login as user1
- Go to settings and select the Coca-Cola theme
- Click on "Apply"

Is the WebApp using the new theme for this user?

---

# The background image of the login screen

Copy a nice background image from the directory /srv/cocacola to the img directory of your plugin, e.g.:
```bash
$ cd /media/sf_theming2017/kopano-webapp/plugins/cocacola/img

$ cp /srv/cocacola/coke-taste-the-feeling-11.jpg ./background.jpg
```

Refresh your browser. Do you see the background?

---

# The logo of the login screen

Logo should be max 220 x 60px

Copy the image called logo_login.png to your plugins image folder
```bash
$ cp /srv/cocacola/logo_login.png .
```

Refresh your browser. Do you see the logo?

---

# The button of the login screen

Open the css file of your plugin (css/theme.css) and change the color and 'hover color' of the button:

```css
(...)
/* The Sign in button of the login screen */
body.login #form-container #submitbutton,
#loading-mask #form-container #submitbutton {
    background: #f40009;
}
/* Hover state and active state of the Sign in button */
body.login #form-container #submitbutton:hover,
#loading-mask #form-container #submitbutton:hover,
body.login #form-container #submitbutton:active,
#loading-mask #form-container #submitbutton:active {
    background: #d40009;
}
(...)
```

---
# Updating the spinner

The spinner is an image (of max 240 x 220px) that is rotated by the CSS
Copy the file bottle.png to the image directory of your plugin
```bash
$ cp /srv/cocacola/bottle.png .
```
Instead of renaming the file we will now update the CSS file of our plugin to use this image
```css
/* The spinner of the login/loading screen */
body.login #form-container.loading .right,
#loading-mask #form-container.loading .right {
  background: url(../img/bottle.png) no-repeat center center;
}
```

---

# The top menubar of the WebApp main view

In the CSS file the color of the bar and the color of the hovered/selected menu items are defined.
Let's update these to the colors of Coca-Cola.

We will use  **#f40009** for the menu bar and **#d40009** (a little darker) for the hovered/selected items.

And we will make the text color of normal menu items a little brighter.

---

# The logo in the WebApp main view

Height preferably 40px (max 45px)

Copy the file called logo_app.png to the image directory of our theme:

```bash
$ cp /srv/cocacola/logo_app.png .
```

Refresh the browser. Is the new logo displayed?

---

# The color of the 'action' items

Action items are items that have a special color to make them stand out, e.g. buttons with major actions attached to it.

We will use the colors **#f40009** and **#d40009** also for the normal state and the hover state of the action items.

---

# Selected items and extra information blocks

The standard colors of the WebApp will be fine for our theme, so we will simply remove the corresponding lines from our
CSS file.

---

# The favicon

We can simply change the favicon of the WebApp by putting a favicon.ico file in our plugin directory.

```bash
$ cd /media/sf_theming2017/kopano-webapp/plugins/cocacola/

$ cp /srv/cocacola/favicon-32x32.png ./favicon.ico

```

You might need to refresh your browser a couple of times before the favicon gets updated.

---

# The welcome screen

First reset the WebApp settings to enter the welcome screen again.

Now, in the CSS file update the color of the top bar
```css
/* The top bar of the Welcome dialog */
.zarafa-welcome-body > .x-panel-bwrap > .x-panel-body div.zarafa-welcome-title {
    border-left: 1px solid #f40009;
    border-right: 1px solid #f40009;
    background: #f40009;
}
```

Refresh the page. Does the top bar have<br/>
the correct color?
